# Placeholders

{% page-ref page="tags.md" %}

## Format

Placeholders follow the standard format of `{placeholder:args...}` 

`placeholder` is they placeholder key. These will all be specific to the place where the placeholder is used and the current guild's language.

`args...` is a comma separated list of arguments to the placeholder. Placeholders usually only have 1 argument.
